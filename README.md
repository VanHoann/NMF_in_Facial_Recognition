We examine the Non-negative Matrix Factorization techniques and its applications
in Facial Recognition. Firstly, we represent the NMF algorithms using the L2-norm
and the KL-divergence as the objective function, then examine the convergence
property of NMF with KL-divergence and propose theoretical ideas to guarantee
this property. Secondly, we analyze both the NMF algorithmsâ€™ performance in
Facial Recognition using a series of experiments on face datasets with different
metrics and in different simulated noise scenarios.
